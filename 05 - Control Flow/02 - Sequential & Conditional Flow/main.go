/*
create a program that uses both SEQUENTIAL and CONDITIONAL control flow. Your
program should do the following:

	- create a random int between 0 and 250
	- store the value of that int in a variable with the identifier of x
		-- func Intn(n int) int
			--- rand.Intn()
	- print out the name and value of the variable

	- use an if statement to do the following
		-- if the value is between 0 and 100
			--- print between 0 and 100
		-- if the value is between 101 and 200
			--- print between 101 and 200
		-- if the value is between 201 and 250
			--- print between 201 and 250

	- re: inclusive, exclusive â€“ does rand.Intn()
		-- include zero in its output?
		-- include 250 in its output?
		-- show this in code using the numbers 0 - 3
	- hint:
		-- &&
